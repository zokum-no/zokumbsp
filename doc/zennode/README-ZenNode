ZenNode v1.2.0
==============

This is directory tree includes the source code necessary to build ZenNode.
Since I don't have a lot of time to spend maintaining the code and there 
haven't been too many changes in the past few years, I've decided to release
the source under the GPL license.  See the file COPYING for details.

Several of the files (i.e. those in the DOOM directory) evolved from earlier
projects.  They contain functionality that is not used in ZenNode and may not
have been kept up to date.  I think it all works, but I won't make any
guarantees.

There is a makefile included in the ZenNode directory that can be used as is
under Linux.  To build ZenNode in any other environment, you can use the
makefile as a guide.  I've built and tested it under Windows using Borland
and Microsoft compilers.  Older versions have been compiled under OS/2 using
Borland.  The code should be portable to other compilers, but it has never
been tested.

Enjoy,
Marc
