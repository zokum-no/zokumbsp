Changelog for ZokumBSP

ZokumBSP 1.0.10-beta1
- Renamed structs and methods in doom/level.* and wad.*
- Converted filenames to lower case.
- Renamed source dirs to all lower case.
- Split wadlist object into its own file, wadlist.cpp
- Added support for linedef 1080-1083 for seg bam trickery.
- Fixed nodes algorithm paramters, a=s,d,f.
- Old nodes algorithms selection now act as aliases for a=s,d,f.
- Rewrote the output, more info, xaser had the column header idea!
- Removed a bug in the split reduction algorithm, it no longer favors lines
  that are horisontal over diagonal or vertical lines with fewer splits.
- Split-reduction algorithm now favors non-diagonal lines if splits are same.

ZokumBSP 1.0.9-rc2
- Turning off blockmap compression is once again possible.
- "-bi" parameter no longer claims to not use basic compression.
- Added checking of return values of memory reallocs in ZenNode.cpp
- Fixed a minor error in the va_args handling in ZenRMB.
- Fixed a mismatch new[] / delete in wad.cpp.

ZokumBSP 1.0.9-rc1
- Added geometry simplification blockmap compression. Also speeds up the
  DOOM engine due to less calculations runtime.
- Added more aggressive simplification of one sided walls in different
  sectors, set with level g=2.
- Made 00 headers default due to bad optimizations in many ports.
- Added a method to add new linedefs.
- Added trimming of linedef list to reduce unneeded linedefs.
- Linedefs with tag 998 will not be added to BSP tree, ie not rendered.
- Renamed PREPROCESS TO GEOMETRY. Added statistics, progress and run time.

ZokumBSP 1.0.8-rc2
- Using 64bit uints in reject code to stop it crashing on large maps. This
  fixed building a reject table on a 2k sector map. Bigger maps still crash
  in a different location.

ZokumBSP 1.0.8-rc1
- Anotak found a nice optimization, moved checks out of a core loop. This 
  gives a 33% speedup.

ZokumBSP 1.0.7-rc2
- Many minor cleanups of the Git repo.
- Anotak added Visual Studio tweaks to make it compile.

ZokumBSP 1.0.7-rc1
- Preprocessing is now done in a seperate step, and data can be used by reject
  and nodes structures if needed.
- New format for the changelog.txt, should be easier to read.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6 (Choose your own offset adventure)
- No changes from rc2.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6-rc2
- Added support for detecting BOOM generalized linedefs and extended linedefs.
- Limited support for a 32bit BLOCKMAP format.

ZokumBSP 1.0.6-rc1
- Use -bo=x,y to specify a specific offset, useful for special effects.
- LoadHexenInfo in level.cpp now checks if the sscanf matches anything. 

ZokumBSP 1.0.5 (Boundary box discarding)
- No changes from rc3

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc3
- Fixed several memory leaks.

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc2
- Distributed prebuilt windows version is built static. No dlls needed.

ZokumBSP 1.0.5-rc1
- Discards looking blocks farther away than the longest linedef in a block.

ZokumBSP 1.0.4 (Argument cleanup and a bit of heuristics)
- Added new heuristic approach to reduce brute force solution space.
- Changed command line arguments to be easier and more foolproof.

ZokumBSP 1.0.3 (Sub block improvement release)
- All non id-compatibe blockmaps are now 2 bytes smaller.
- No longer assumes 2s flag means a linedef is two-sided.

ZokumBSP 1.0.2  (Speed improvements)
- Sorted blocks allow for quicker generation / comparisons.
- Minor enhancements. Better sorting algorithm from stdlib.
- HTML output switch.
- HTML output is now usable.
- Massive speed improvements.
- Reformatted help screen.
- Fixed a ZenNode bug when an invalid wad file is specified.

ZokumBSP 1.0.1 (Released as closed source for testing)
- Compiles on windows vis MinGW.
- Id blockmap header now optional
- Support for 8x8 id offset.
- Can generate id-compatible smaller blockmaps.
- Support for tag 999 never blocking lines.
- Algorithm for finding never blocking lines.
- Option: Find sub block lists to improve blockmap size.

ZokumBSP 1.0.0 (Initial test release)
- Added brute force 128*128 origin.
